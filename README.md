# 🍋 yuzu
A template for using [web components](https://open-wc.org/discover/about/#why-web-components) to build dynamic, highly interactive experiences with [`Lit`](https://lit.dev/) and [`Shoelace`](https://shoelace.style/).

```js
  [`Websites`, `Applications`, `Extensions`, ...more].every(canBuildWithYuzu) // true
```

## Details

### Why

> There are a thousand options for building websites! Why would you build this?

This is highly tailored to what I need it to be so I never have to fight my build system. If there is something missing, or something that feels clunky, I can change it.
