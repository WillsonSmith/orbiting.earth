# Project Template

Work in progress, more to come.

## Description

An evolving template for building front-ene web applications. This project template is built on web components, it includes [`Shoelace`](https://shoelace.style/) and [`LitElement`](https://lit.dev/) as well as a number of custom web components that are built on an as-needed basis.

The build system contains a series of `node` scripts that use [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/) for transpiling the source code. There are very few guard rails, and, as a result, builds are highly customizable.

The project is oriented towards [netlify](https://www.netlify.com), but there are no hard lock-ins.
